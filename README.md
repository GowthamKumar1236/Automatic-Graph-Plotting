# Automatic-Graph-Plotting

Created a graph function that takes any dataset and create plots for numerical variables and categorical variables then save them as PNG files in a specified
repository.

The functions also give an additional argument to the user to choose a list of columns. If no list of columns is given the default setting must choose all the columns
of the dataset.
